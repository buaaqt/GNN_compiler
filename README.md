# Pytorch Graph Neural Networks Compiler

This is a pytorch implementation of Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) Compiler

The repo has been forked initially from https://github.com/tkipf/pygcn and https://github.com/Diego999/pyGAT.

The branch **master** contains the implementation of GAT and GCN models oriented to 'cora' dataset.
